# robust-website
java version "1.8.0_231"

### Instructions:
After the generator.java program has been compiled <br>
Run run.sh with parameters databaseFolder outputFolder <br>
Where databaseFolder is the path to the robust folder <br>
and outputFolder is the folder where the files will be generated

either path can be absolute or relative <br>
eg: <br>
	./run.sh C:/tmp/robust ../out

NB!
Some terminals treat backslashes "\" as escape characters which means
that they need to be replaced by either forward slash "/" or double backslashes "\\"

C:\tmp\robust -> C:/tmp/robust
